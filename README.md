# IoTLongboard
The IOT Longboard was conceived as a connected, feedback-based longboard that  would allow the user to communicate instructions - from lighting patterns  personalization to GPS navigation - while receiving information - distance, time spent etc.  Design considerations were carefully thought to create a product that would endure  different conditions and environments, pretty much like a longboard would have to, and  were specially designed to create a much better user experience: the only hardware-level  interaction involves battery charging, while all the other commands and communication  can be done through the web. Sizing turned out to be an impressive driver of our design,  given the small surface area and the necessity of having resistant systems, and the  distribution/layout of our components had to be redesigned multiple times before a  3D-printing stage.  Our project was based on many other project proposals (found on countless Maker  social media and websites), including instructables.com’s tips to power LED Strips to  Adafruit’s own tutorials for using their products.  Our approach to the software coding consisted mainly on dividing our block diagram  into minimal steps and creating chunks of algorithms for each fundamental component  of the project: e.g. we would code lighting LEDs functions and GPS coordination  functions, then write the integration for the GPS+LED orientation algorithms.
